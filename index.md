# The Idea

The Simpsons first appeared on the television screen in 1989. Today, it is the longest running animates series of all time. 

Over 600 Simpsons episodes in 30 seasons have been realeased over the past 30 years, but over the past decade the series seems to been declining in quality. The ratings and number of viewers have both been decreasing steadily over the years.


Some say it's because of new writers, but here the goal is dig into scripts and the synopsis of each episode in order to see if any patterns can be detected that could help us understand what has happened to the series.

# 1. Data
Some basic stats that we have done already

---
# 2. The Network
Visulization of the network and some info on it

---

# 3. Wordcloud
General about the wordcloud and then we can make some chapters for different representations


## 3.1 Main Characters 
Dropdownlist to choose which character to look at

# 4. Sentimental Analysis

Here the goal is to show how the sentiment score of the seasons have changed through the 30 years of production and put it into perspective with the decreasing ratings and views. Sentimental Analysis aims to measure the happiness in text on a 9-point scale. The higher the score, the more happiness in the text.

In order to rate the sentiment of words, a datafile with 10,222 words and their happiness score was used, see [here](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0026752). The sentiment scores were calculated as the average of sentiment scores for the text considered. If a word did not have a sentiment score it was disregarded from the calculation.

Sentimental Analysis was carried out on the scripts and the synopsis. The main findings are presented in the following chapters.


## 4.1 Main Characters


## 4.2 Seasons

# 5. Webpage Requirements
This part of the assignment is quite free. The main point of the website is to present your idea/analyses to the world in a way that showcases your use of what you've learned in class. It can be as simple as an oldfashioned static web-page, and as complicated as you want it to be. Let your creativity run wild (but keep in mind that this is not a coding class - we care mostly about content and analysis).

The website should be self-contained and tell the story of your dataset without the need for the Explainer Notebook (the purpose of the notebook is to provide additional details for interested readers). Here are some requirements

The page should say clearly what the dataset is and give the reader some idea of its most important properties (kind of Project Assignment A-style).
The page should contain your network and text analysis (that's the main part).
There should be download options for data sets (so the user can play around).
You must link to the Explainer Notebook (more details below) that explains the details of your analysis (including all of the machine learning, the model selection, etc). You can achieve this with a link to an IPython notebook displaying on the nbviewer.
For hosting, I recommend using your DTU website or github pages.
