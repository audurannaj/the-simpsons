Over 600 Simpsons episodes in 30 seasons have been realeased over the past 30 years. 
The ratings and number of viewers have both been decreasing steadily over the years.
Some say it's because of new writers, but here the goll is dig into the scripts and the synopsis to see if any patterns can be decteded that could decribe this decline.

# 5. Webpage Requirements
This part of the assignment is quite free. The main point of the website is to present your idea/analyses to the world in a way that showcases your use of what you've learned in class. It can be as simple as an oldfashioned static web-page, and as complicated as you want it to be. Let your creativity run wild (but keep in mind that this is not a coding class - we care mostly about content and analysis).

The website should be self-contained and tell the story of your dataset without the need for the Explainer Notebook (the purpose of the notebook is to provide additional details for interested readers). Here are some requirements

The page should say clearly what the dataset is and give the reader some idea of its most important properties (kind of Project Assignment A-style).
The page should contain your network and text analysis (that's the main part).
There should be download options for data sets (so the user can play around).
You must link to the Explainer Notebook (more details below) that explains the details of your analysis (including all of the machine learning, the model selection, etc). You can achieve this with a link to an IPython notebook displaying on the nbviewer.
For hosting, I recommend using your DTU website or github pages.
